Nowadays everone in their mother is being called a Fascist, and it can quite
confusing to really know what it even means to be one in the first place. However
don't be fooled into thinking that means no-one is harbouring fascist tendancies,
and this site is here to help you sus out any potential crypto-fascists you come
across.

The questions in this quiz are taken directly from Umberto Eco's essay on "Ur-Fascism", which is widely regarded as the definitive guide to fascist
thought. While a fascist need not hit all the points, it's not as strict an ideology like socialism or capitalism, the more points one hits, the more likely they are to be one.
